MEMORY
My Goal: My goal remains to retrieve the American limited edition keycard from the type 1 box, unlock the American limited edition gate, open the gate, and move east to pick up the shirt from the floor of the attic.
My Current Situation: I'm in the scullery, with the keycard in my possession and the American limited edition gate open, leading east. There is also a closed door leading south. In the scullery, I discovered that the type 1 box is empty, which is disappointing.
My Next Plan: Since I have already achieved my goal of unlocking the gate, my next plan is to explore what lies beyond the open American limited edition gate. I will head east to see what awaits me in the area beyond the gate. However, I should also consider checking the closed door to the south to ensure I don't miss any potential clues or items that might be useful on my journey.
